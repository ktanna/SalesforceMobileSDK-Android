# Introduction

This folder contains the native sample projects that can be used to exercise the SDK, and test projects associated with those sample projects.

# Setting up your development environment

Please follow the instructions for setting up your development environment from the README file at the root of this repo, prior to working with the Salesforce SDK.

For the rest of this document, we assume that you have setup three shell variables:

1. ANDROID_SDK_DIR pointing to the Android SDK directory
2. SALESFORCE_SDK_DIR pointing to your clone of the Salesforce Mobile SDK repository e.g. `/home/jon/SalesforceMobileSDK-Android`.
3. NATIVE_DIR pointing to $SALESFORCE_SDK_DIR/native
4. LIBS_DIR pointing to $SALESFORCE_SDK_DIR/libs

**If you haven't, just make sure to replace $ANDROID_SDK_DIR, $SALESFORCE_SDK_DIR, $NATIVE_DIR and $LIBS_DIR in the snippets below with the actual paths.**

Inside the $NATIVE_DIR, you will find several projects:

1. **TemplateApp**: Template used when creating new native application using SalesforceSDK
2. **test/TemplateAppTest**: Test project for the TemplateApp project
3. **SampleApps/RestExplorer**: An app using SalesforceSDK to explore the REST API calls
4. **SampleApps/test/RestExplorerTest**: Test project for the RestExplorer project
5. **SampleApps/NativeSqlAggregator**: An app using SalesforceSDK and SmartStore to demonstrate complex aggregate smart SQL queries
6. **SampleApps/SmartSyncExplorer**: An app using SmartSync to demonstrate synching a list of contacts from and to the server

# Running sample apps from Eclipse

2. Go to Window -> Preferences, choose the Android section, and enter the the Android SDK location.
3. Go to File -> Import and select General -> Existing Projects into Workspace.
4. Select $SALESFORCE_SDK_DIR as your root directory and import the projects described above.
5. Right click on any of the sample apps and choose Run As -> Android Application to run it.
6. Right click on any of the test project and choose Run As -> Android JUnit Test to run the tests.

# Creating a new native application using SalesforceSDK
